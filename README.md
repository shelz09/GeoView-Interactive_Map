## GeoView-Interactive_Map
1. GeoView is an interactive & user-friendly web app which lets the user know his location, search places and find "Near me" places to visit
2. To show the map, GeoView uses a JavaScript library called 'Leaflet' which is imported into the project by adding its css and script cdn to our html file.
3. To let the user search places, OpenStreetMap APIs are used in GeoView.
4. Additionally, to provide the 'near-me' feature, a function is made that handles and searches the near by places as selected like Restaurants, Hotels, Hospitals and Banks within the radius of 5km of the center point of map.
5. Keeping in mind of Responsiveness, GeoView is a responsive web-app supported on all sceen sizes of mobile phones, tablets and Computers
6. I hope you like the project, keep building guys!
